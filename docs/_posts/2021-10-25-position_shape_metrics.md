We have just uploaded a notebook explaining the design of specific metrics for location and shape retrievement. It describes the methodology to quantify the accuracy of an algorithm in estimating position and geometry of scatterers. These are the $\zeta_{P}$ and $\zeta_{S}$ indicators, respectively.
