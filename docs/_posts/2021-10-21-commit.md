* Fixed use of `tight_layout` Matplolib's function when plotting multiple figures and when plotting the total field stored in the `InputData` class.
* Added the argument `mode` to `CaseStudy.reconstruction` to allow display only the best or all reconstructions done by the stochastic algorithms executions.
