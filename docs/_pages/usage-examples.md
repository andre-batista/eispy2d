We provide some usage examples. Check out:

* [Manual definition](https://github.com/andre-batista/eispy2d/blob/main/demo/example_manual_definition.ipynb) of a problem and execution of a single inverse solver with results analysis (Jupyter Notebook).
* Case Study: a basic example about how to use the `CaseStudy` class. See first the [script](https://github.com/andre-batista/eispy2d/blob/main/demo/example_case_study.py) and the [notebook](https://github.com/andre-batista/eispy2d/blob/main/demo/example_case_study.ipynb) with the a-posterior analysis.
* Benchmark: a basic example about how to use the `Benchmark` class. See first the [script](https://github.com/andre-batista/eispy2d/blob/main/demo/example_benchmark.py) and the [notebook](https://github.com/andre-batista/eispy2d/blob/main/demo/example_benchmark.ipynb) with the a-posterior analysis.
