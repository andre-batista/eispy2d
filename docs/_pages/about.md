## Motivation

This library was thought to provide a common and basic framework for researchers that want to test new ideas about algorithms for EISPs. Then, they will not need to develop the whole structure (domain model, discretization formulations, forward solvers, data visualization, statistical inference, etc).

## What can I do with this library?

With the tools in this library, you can represent an instance of EISP, develop algorithms, run them, and analyze the results in many different ways. The library provides specific implementations for case studies and benchmarking, so one can get preliminary results, measure the performance, and compare with different algorithms or different versions of the same algorithm.

## Model assumptions

Besides considering the two-dimensional formulation, we are assuming as well TMz polarization of incident waves and linear, isotropic, non-dispersive, and non-magnetic materials.

## Contribute

**You are totally welcome to contribute to this library** by finding bugs, suggesting changes, implementing the algorithms in the literature, and providing your algorithms so others can use them to compare in their experiments. You may add issues, send pull requests or contact me through e-mail.

## Citation

The paper is under review. So, we hope that soon you will be able to acknowledge by citing it.
